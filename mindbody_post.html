            <p>I perceive the mind and the body are two separate entities. At birth, we were presented with this body for our soul to inhibit. It has many predisposed to certain traits and qualities, bound by our genetics. It serves as a baseline for the capabilities and personality for this human body. Throughout the course of our life, we gradually gain a better understanding of our body. From learning which foods and activities it finds pleasure in to which virtues in life it places the most importance in, we are constantly learning more and more about the intricacies of the human body. </p>

            <p>It can be a little confusing to describe how I envision it, but here is an analogy that may better capture my thoughts. I picture the human body as a complex instrument and the soul as a musician. At birth, the soul has never picked up this instrument before. Gradually, with time and effort the soul becomes more adequate in handling this intricate instrument. It may never become a master, but it is about the journey, not the destination. </p>
            
            <p>This is very abstract thinking, so let me bring it back to myself. Iâ€™ve been alive for 23 years, almost 24 years old. I think I am at a point where I can reflect on my personal journey and how my soul has reached the point it is right now. Here is what I have learned about myself. This is pretty personal, but I am using this as a medium to note where I am at this point in my life. Who knows, I may be a totally different person down the road. I will refer to my body in the third person and my soul in the first. </p>
            
            <p>Since a very young age, Kedar has expressed a delicate fondness of the world around him, displayed calmness in the most stressful situations, embraced independence, and unafraid of being alone and silence. He prefers being well-rounded over specialized, and this is pertinent in everything, including knowledge, sports, food, and hobbies. Although he is fundamentally the same, he has definitely evolved over the years, as has any human being. He has become a lot more extroverted, vocal, a better leader, and more firm and opinionated. </p>
            
            <p>As the soul, I have observed this transition and help set goals with </p>
            
            <p>Kedar has always been a quiet person who enjoys silence and basking in his own thoughts. Silence is comforting, it gives him a sense of peace and calm. He gets excited to start new projects, but finds himself getting bored or losing focus quickly. He possesses the work ethic, but only utilizes it when it is something he is really passionate about. Over time, he has developed his social skills </p>
