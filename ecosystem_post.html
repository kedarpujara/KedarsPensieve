          <p>Ecosystems are something everyone learns about growing up, primarily in a biological context. I’m going to be talking about it more generally, and referring to it as any general interconnected system. </p>

          <p>I’ve been curious about this topic because I see myself as a very independent person. I feel as if I do not need the support of others to find my way through life. I find myself rejecting assistance and support in most situations because I find myself fit to do a job on my own, whether it is studying for an exam, directions, or just finding a way to utilize my free time. Pretty much most things I feel I can do independently. </p>
          
          <p>I like to just sit and think about the world around me, so when I listened to a podcast on the free trade movement it fueled my brain to take it further. In the free trade movement, people from different lands began to trade with each other freely. Each country had certain abundant resources and certain crafts they were more proficient at. Thus, if they traded what they could more abundantly produce, then both parties would benefit. </p>
          
          <p>This was an ecosystem. It was an interconnected system with parts that relied on each other to run smoothly. Fast forward to the 21st century and the reason humans are successful is because we have learned to utilize the concept of ecosystems in so many facets of our society. For example, governmental infrastructure, taxes, technology, food, tourism, and so much more. We are able to drive on roads because governments take our taxes into maintaining our roads. We are able to take flights because we have pilots that get paid to learn how to fly an airplane and safely and rapidly take passengers around the world. Using technologies such as Google Maps, Facebook, online taxis, laptops and smartphones work because the companies and the consumers rely on each other to stay afloat. Music artists can afford to spend their time making music because we as consumers are willing to pay to have artists continue producing more of their craft. </p>
          
          <p>To summarize, this whole world is built on infrastructure that relies on humans cooperating and relying on each other. It is an incredibly large, invisible mesh of woven networks building this complex ecosystem that allows humans to live with more ease than ever before and has allowed for such a diversification of earning money. I no longer entertain the thought that I am independent. In fact, my life might nearly collapse if I was totally independent from the beginning. The concepts of goods and trading is taken for granted, at least in my eyes. It allowed for a whole new generation of economics founded by supply and demand to take control of our society. </p>
          
          <p>I truly find it beautiful how we are able to take advantage of humans being able to communicate and produce goods that can benefit both parties. I am not insisting that there are not currently any holes in this ecosystem of specialized goods and trades that we have setup as a species, but it has been one of the largest reasons we have progressed so much as a society. </p>
          
          <p>I am dependent. I am dependent on society. I am proud to live in a society I can depend on. I am happy to be a human. </p>
